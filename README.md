## About Us
MoreHealth Africa was established to provide effective solutions and interventions to a myriad of public health concerns with emphasis on,
- maternal mortality
- infectious Diseases
- non-communicabl diseases.

This we do by an initial thorough assessment of the problem- aetiology, risk factors, source, accelerators and baseline data(if any).
The peculiarities of the environment are determined in order to develop a customized intervention readily accepted and adopted by the target beneficiaries for best results.
This has proven to be a fail-safe method as interventions adopted by the host community/communities record better compliance and a higher success rate.

From 2016 we have been involved in disease control programmes for the  government of Nigeria on Lassa fever.
We have been involved in maternal mortality interventions through health worker trainings and distribution of childbirth delivery kits.
We have developed and executed the Lock Out Lassa programme which reached over 270,000 persons across 27 local government areas of the Niger Delta.
